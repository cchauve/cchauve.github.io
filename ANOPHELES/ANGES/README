Format of CARs

Each CAR is composed of a list of oriented genes, organized linearly
into groups of genes that are contiguous, although the order between
the different groups can be flexible. A group of contiguous genes is
framed by two possible pairs of symbols: _Q ... Q_ or _P ... P_ (the
latter occurs very rarely, only 15 times in all ancestors).

The order of blocks between _Q and Q_ is fixed, but a block can be
completely reversed (Q-node of a PQ-tree structure, see DOI:
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000234). The order of blocks between _P and P_
is free.

Consecutive genes, not separated by _P, P_, _Q, Q_ form an adjacency.
