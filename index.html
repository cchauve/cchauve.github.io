<p>Welcome to the Computational Paleogenomics group of
<a href="http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~cchauve">Cedric Chauve</a>,
<a href="http://www.math.sfu.ca">Department of Mathematics</a> and
<a href="http://www.irmacs.sfu.ca">Interdisciplinary Research in the Mathematical and Computational Sciences (IRMACS) Centre</a>
at 
<a href="http://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>.</p>

<p>
The research of our group focuses primarily on computational
approaches to understand the evolution of the architecture of genomes
through genome rearrangements. Currently, our main interest considers
the problem of inferring the architecture of ancestral genomes (of
extinct species) through the comparison of related extant genomes (of
descendants species and close outgroups). We also work on connected
topics, namely phylogenomics, gene family evolution, in order to infer
the ancestral gene content of extinct species, and genome
rearrangements that aim at understanding large-scale evolutionary
events between related species, both extant and extinct.
