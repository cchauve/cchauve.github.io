<p>Welcome to the "Computational Methods for Paleogenomics and Comparative Genomics" group of
<a href="http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~cchauve">Cedric Chauve</a>,
<a href="http://www.math.sfu.ca">Department of Mathematics</a> 
at 
<a href="http://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>.</p>

<p>
The research of our group focuses currently on various problems in <b>comparative genomics</b>.
We are working on various problems related to phylogenomics (the construction and analysis of 
gene families and gene trees), genome rearrangements and the reconstruction of ancestral gene orders,
pathogen genomics (genotyping, epidemiologic clustering) and cancer genomics. We are also working
on machine-learning algorithms for the analysis of large-scale flow cytometry data.
</p>

See our <a href="research.html">Research page</a> for more details.
