<font color="FF0000">Open positions.</font> If you are interested in
the application of mathematical and computational methods in biology,
we plan to admit new graduate students (PhD or MSc), starting
in september 2014, to work on computational paleogenomics problems.
<br>
Candidates with a BSc in mathematics or computer science and a serious
interest in computational biology are welcome to apply either through
the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/math/graduate.html">Department of
Mathematics, SFU</a> (deadline January 15th, 2014) or
the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/madd-gen.html">MADD-GEN graduate
program (Computational Methods for the Analysis of the Dynamics and
Diversity of Genomes)</a>.
<br>
Alternatively, you can apply to
the <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/graduateprogram/admissions.html">School
of Computing Science, SFU</a> (deadline February 1st, 2014) or
the <a href="http://bioinformatics.bcgsc.ca/index.html">CIHR/MSFHR
bioinformatics training program</a>. 
<br>
Finally, we welcome at any time applications from motivated
undergraduate students to work with us, either as coop interns or as
USRA interns.
