# Mathematical aspects of Pacific NorthWest Nations culture

I collaboration with my colleague <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~vjungic/">Dr. Veselin Jungic</a>, 
the <a href="https://www.tlaaminnation.com/">Tla'amin Nation</a>, and 
Byron Chu from <a href="https://www.cybera.ca/">Cybera</a>, we have been working
on the development of educational resources, such as <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>
and lesson plans, aimed et being used in K-12 education to discover and experience with
various mathematical aspects of the culture of Pacific NorthWest nations.

We have developed resources around two projects: geometric motifs in woven baskets and stone fish traps.

This work is funded by the <a href="https://pims.math.ca">Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences</a>
through the <a href="https://www.callysto.ca/">Callysto</a> project. The resources we developed are available
through Callysto, <a href="https://www.callysto.ca/indigenous-content/">Indigenous Content</a>.

## Woven basket motifs.

This work was done with Howell Tan, Jennipher Pham, Laura Gutierrez Funderburk.

Our work on woven basket motifs is available at <a href="https://www.callysto.ca/indigenous-content/">Callysto Indigenous Content</a> and 
<a href="https://cchauve.github.io/Callysto-Salish-Baskets/">Interactive notebooks for creating Coast Salish basket motifs<a/>.

Ongoing project, with Kaj Wilson and Haruto Matsui. More to come soon.
