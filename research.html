<h2>Genome evolution</h2> 
One of our favorite research problems, an historically the initial research of ur group, 
is the reconstruction of
ancestral genome structures (genome maps based on synteny blocks, or
ancestral gene orders) [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29277873">MMB 2018</a>]. 
Our main approach follows the comparative paradigm, that
assumes that conserved features of related extant genomes indicate
potential ancestral genome features.  We work within two
methodological frameworks for this problem: a local approach, that
considers a single ancestral genome within a given species phylogeny 
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19043541">PLoS Comput Biol (2008)</a>,
 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22820205">ANGES (2012)</a>],
and a global (aka small parsimony approach), that considers all
ancestral genomes of a species phylogeny at once [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28166504">PhySca (2017)</a>].

<p>
Lately, we aim to extend these approaches in order to iwork within a model accounting for 
gene family events such as gene duplication,
loss or transfert. In this approach, we developed a probablistic
approach within the DeCo* algorithmic framework
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28402423">DeCoSTAR (2017)</a>]. This
line of work also motivated a series of papers on the
correction of gene trees
[<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25161242">PolytomySolverNAD
(2014)</a>] and on the reconciliation between gene trees and species
trees
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27153713">ecceTERA (2016)</a>].

<h2>Ancient DNA</h2>
The recent breakthroughs in ancient DNA (aDNA) sequencing naturally complements
complement methods for reconstructing ancient genomes. This motivated our project to
assemble recently sequenced historical samples of the pathogen <i>Yersinia pestis</i>,
showing that it is possible to go beyond single nucleotide mutations to analyze ancient 
pathogens data
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24068034">FPSAC (2013)</a>,
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29114402">AGaPES (2017)</a>].

<h2>Anopheles mosquito genomics</h2>  
We are also currently applying our comparative genomics and genome rearrangement algorithms to 
a fascinating, large-scale, data set composed of toughly twenty <i>Anopheles</i> mosquito genomes 
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25554792">Science (2015)</a>]. 
This in turn raises interesting questions on how to handle fragmented genome assemblies in genome 
rearrangement studies [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26450761">ArtDeCo (2015)</a>].
  
<h2>Pathogen genomics</h2> 
We recently started a very active collaboration with the SFU Computational Epidemiology lab of 
<a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~leonid">Dr. Leonid Chindelevitch</a>, 
and Dr. Will Hsiao (BC center for Disease Control), focusing on the development and application of 
novel bioinformatics tools for the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data of microbial pathogens.
We recently published our first papers on this topic 
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695621">Beaver fever (2018)</a>,
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29319471">MentaLiST (2018)</a>].

<h2>Next-Generation Sequencing algorithms</h2>
In a recently started collaboration with Faraz Hach (UBC and Vacouver Prostate Center)  
we are developing novel and efficient algorithms for processing large genomic and transcriptomic sequence
data sets, mostly motivated by questions from cancer genomics. We are currently focusing on the analysis of
Third Generation Sequencing data (PacBio and Nanopore) [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27587673">CoLoRMap (2016)</a>,
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29036421">LRCstats (2017)</a>].
  
<h2>Big data flow cytometry bioinformatics</h2>
This topic is relatively new in our lab. 
It stems from a starting collaboration with Ryan Brinkman (BC Cancer Agency) and Sara Mostafavi 
(UBC), funded by Genome Canada. 
Our first paper was just released [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29462241">flowLearn (2018)</a>].

<h2>RNA secondary structures comparison.</h2>
Another question we investigated very early. Here we are mostly interested in developing accurate and efficient
algorithm to compare pairs of RNA secondary structures. Among others, we have
been involved in the development of
the <a href="http://brasero.labri.fr/">BRASERO benchmark</a>, the analysis of the  
[<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26984616">BRALIBASE benchmark dent (2016)</a>], 
and in the design of efficient dynamic programming algorithms for comparing
RNA secondary structures
[<a href="http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-38827-4_5.pdf">AlCoB (2016)</a> , 
 <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25768236">RNA-unchained (2015)</a>].
